The alias given by oneâ€™s parents is sometimes the only alias needed for the rest of their life.

Yet for some, as their self transforms, a new sound of how they must be called emerges from a myriad of circumstances and experiences.

So it is the case for me.

It is said that the Beginning of the Universe started with a Word.

So it is the beginning of a titanic, myserious, humbling, and desirable lifetime for me.

You knew me as Jay, which is still welcome. For that title has carried me to the ever-delightful Now.

And now you can know me anew -- as Silas Path.

The Unique Self desires and recognizes it.

One of the great poets proclaims:

> Love is the universe shouting out a joyful yes when our names our called.

To say the least, it is madly pleasant to bring this calling forth.

Love and wisdom,
Silas
